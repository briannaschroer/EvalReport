<h1>BRIANNA'S EVALUATION REPORT</h1>

<div id="welcome">

<h3>Participants</h3>

<p>Allison is also a print designer and one of my co-workers. We differ in our design style, so I thought it would be helpful to get her opinion. I asked her to specifically look at the layout and design of the page. To evaluate my website she used her Mac Book Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 with 8GB RAM, Mac OS X 10.11.6 and used Chrome 54.0.2840.71. She was plugged in to the University’s high speed Internet at the Columbia Missourian.</p>

<p>Kaitlyn falls in my target market age group, but she doesn’t know much about design. She is one of my friends from high school. I thought it would be a good idea to get an outsiders perspective to test the usability of the website. I wanted Kaitlyn to focus on the navigation and the readability of the fonts/images/etc. Kaitlyn also used her Mac Book Pro 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 with 8GB RAM, Mac OS X 10.11.6 and used Safari 9.1.3. She was plugged in to home Charter DSL.</p>

<p>Micheala was my last user. I met her in my coding class last year. She has a lot of journalism experience, so I thought she would be a good person to look at my content. She was able to give me a good idea of what I need to remove and add to my website before I send it to potential employers. Micheala was using her Mac Book Pro, running on El Capitan. She was using institution Internet on Google Chrome</p>

<p>All of the users said that they had an easy time navigating my website. They were able to find what they were looking for without any trouble. They appreciated the simple design because it was easy to read and didn’t distract from the clips.</p>

<p>Allison found a few places with awkward spacing and I went ahead and fixed those issues. She also thought my text was a little too big, so I am going to look into that. I want to make sure it is a good size for both desktop and mobile. Allison thought the homepage was a bit plain, so I plan on working on that.</p>

<p>Kaitlyn had an easy time finding my contact information and information about me, which was good. She had an easy time navigating the website, but wished that I had separate pages for each of my publications.</p>

<p>Micheala liked the content that I had on my pages, but wished there was a lot more. I agree, and plan on putting more clips on my website. She also said that the homepage was pretty bare. She encouraged me to add a place to download my resume.</p>

<p>Overall, people had a pretty easy and successful time using my website. Everyone that reviewed my website was on a Mac, so I plan on asking a few PC users to take a look. There were no major issues with the website loading or anything technical. Most of the things I need to work on are cosmetic or content driven. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done, but it is getting there!</p>

<h3>Planned Changes</h3>
<p>Based on my feedback, there are several things that I am going to change on my website.</p>

<h4><strong>Improving design and navigation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home page:</strong> I am going to address everyone’s concerns on the homepage. Both Micheala and Allison agreed that the homepage was really bare. I plan to add photos of my clips that link to the different pages on the homepage. This will give the homepage more color and address Kaitlin’s concern about having different pages for each publication.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Kaitlyn had an easy time finding my information, but suggested that I changed the word “about” to contact. This will make it easier for potential employers to find my information. I get a few more opinions before I change that.</li>
<li><strong>Fonts:</strong> I wanted Kaitlyn to focus on fonts and readability and she had no issues. She made a few suggestions about italics in a few spaces and I made those changes. No one else brought up issues with fonts, so I plan on keeping them.</li>
<li><strong>Display of photos:</strong> Some mentioned making the about photo less awkward on the page, so I am going to work on that. I agree that it looks out of place.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Improving Content</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home page:</strong> All agree that the home page is lacking content, so that is going to be one of the first things I work on.</li>
<li><strong>Work:</strong> I got a low score from Micheala and Allison on "in-depth" work, so I plan on adding a lot more work to my pages. I also plan on updating it regularly to encourage people to return.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Improving Credibility</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> You can find my email on every page, so there are no problems here. I have an updated footer on all pages, so the users know that the pages are current.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Improving code</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Micheala was the only one of my users that had an in-depth knowledge of coding. She suggested that I go though my CSS and get rid of the things that I am not using. There are several things in there that I have tried out and forgot to delete.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>It was interesting to get an groups of outsiders to look at my website. I got a lot of different perspectives and I think it was very beneficial. Allison gave me a lot of good design tips that I didn’t think of, since I have been staring at this website for so long.</p>

<p>I think it was great to get someone’s perspective that doesn’t know anything about design. Kaitlyn was able to focus on the navigation and usability and gave me great ideas on how to make it more user friendly.</p>

<p>Micheala was able to look at my code and showed me how to simplify it. This will be very helpful in the long run as I continue to add to the site.</p>

<p>All in all I got some great suggestions. I am excited to get to work and have them look at my website when it is finished. I think this website is going to be great by the end of this.</p>
